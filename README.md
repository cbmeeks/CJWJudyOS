# OldieOS
This OS has a currently stable kernel with no known fatals.
In order to make the system run, either port it or stick it in some ROMs and make the system with the specs of the SYSTEM.txt.
You can also run this system virtually on "6502 simulator 1.2.11" by Michael Kowalski.  That was how I test it, but I will make it run on actual hardware soon.
