In order to make the default compatible system, do the following:
1. Make sure there is a free running IRQ clock.  It does not have to be a RTC.
2. Give the system 64K RAM that copies all chips, even though you should give addresses $7000 - $F1FF to ROM
3. Use a "W65C02S" MPU if possible!  Not only is this for speed but it is also the only commercially available 65c02!
4. NEVER give the IRQ vectors to ROM, as this will cause bad timing on the IRQ routine if it is not timed to the kernel exactly and cause a 
memory leak on the stack.
5. When writing programs, stick the kernel ROM into $F000, and your programs somewhere between that and $7000.
6. I recommend making a circuit to load $7000-$EFFF ROM once every swap, which this must be done with hardware and DMA to ROM.
7. Make sure each program is under 4K of ROM until memory swapping is written into the kernel!
